//These are the files I'm working on for the website
//Styles.css is linked to the html but the partial files are linked into here, Style.scss
//Then they all load onto the CSS file from this one 
//Would be handy for bigger projects
//Figured out later that I should have been using @use but kept the forward because it also worked
//@Forward is rather used if your scss files are in another folder 

@forward 'base.scss';
@forward 'header';
@forward 'main';
