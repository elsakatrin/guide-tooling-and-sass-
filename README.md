# guide-tooling-and-sass-
I made this simple website with learning sass rather than making a pretty website
I read about sass and then I decided to do the following aspects with Sass:
Partial files, 
Variables, 
Nesting styles, 
Mixins, 
Extend/inheritance.

I tried to explain everything I did in the code so please take a look at that :)
